////
Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
* file name: ref-my-reference-a.adoc
* ID: [id="ref-my-reference-a_{context}"]
* Title: = My reference A
////

////
Indicate the module type in one of the following
ways:
Add the prefix ref- or ref_ to the file name.
Add the following attribute before the module ID:
:_content-type: REFERENCE
////

////
The ID is an anchor that links to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
////

[id="ref-reference-material_{context}"]

////
The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.
////

= Reference material
////
In the title of a reference module, include nouns that are used in the body text. For example, "Keyboard shortcuts for ___" or "Command options for ___." This helps readers and search engines find the information quickly.

Be sure to include a line break between the title and the module introduction.
////

[role="_abstract"]
Write a short introductory paragraph that provides an overview of the module.

A reference module provides data that users might want to look up, but do not need to remember. It has a very strict structure, often in the form of a list or a table.
A well-organized reference module enables users to scan it quickly to find the details they want.
AsciiDoc markup to consider for reference data:

.Unordered list

* Use a consistent system for file names, IDs, and titles.
