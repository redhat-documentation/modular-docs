= Concept Module Guidelines

The core requirement for a concept module is explaining the idea, or concept.
A concept module requires a short introduction and optionally, can also include additional resources.

When planning a concept module, look at nouns in related procedure modules and assemblies to find the concepts to explain to users.
Explain only things that are visible to users.
Even if a concept is interesting, it probably does not require an explanation if it is not visible to users.

== Concept Introduction

The introduction to a concept module is a single, concise paragraph that provides a short overview of the module.
A short description makes the module more usable because users can quickly determine whether the concept is useful without having to read the entire module.

The introduction typically answers the following questions:

* What is the concept?
* Why should the user care about the concept?

== Concept Body

The concept body describes the subject of the concept module.

Apart from paragraphs, you can use other AsciiDoc elements, such as lists, tables, or examples.
Consider including graphics or diagrams to speed up the understanding of the concept.

Do not include any instructions to perform an action, such as executing a command.
Action items belong in procedure modules.
See also link:http://www.informationmapping.com/fspro2013-tutorial/infotypes/infotype2.html[The Six Information Types] at _informationmapping.com_ for ways to present different types of conceptual information: principle, concept, structure, process, fact.

If the concept module is large and complex, consider splitting the concept module into multiple standalone concept modules. If you cannot split the module into meaningful standalone modules, consider using subheadings in the module to structure the content for improved reader navigation. If you use subheadings in a concept module, you can add the `[discrete]` tag to exclude each subheading from the table of contents, if needed. However, in many cases, subheadings are helpful to include in the table of contents to improve content searchability.

The following examples illustrate a discrete and a standard subheading:

.Example discrete subheading excluded from table of contents
[source]
----
= My concept module

Concept introduction and body

[discrete]
== My concept module subheading

More concept body content
----

.Example subheading included in table of contents
[source]
----
= My concept module

Concept introduction and body

== My concept module subheading

More concept body content
----

NOTE: You can use subheadings in concept or reference modules, but not in procedure modules.

[discrete]
== Concept Additional Resources

The optional additional resources list links to other material closely related to the contents of the concept module, for example, other documentation resources.
Because of current tooling limitations, you cannot include xref links to other content in your collection in the concept module.
You can include xref links in the assembly that contains the concept.

Focus on relevant resources that are likely to be of immediate interest to the user. Do not list resources for completeness.
