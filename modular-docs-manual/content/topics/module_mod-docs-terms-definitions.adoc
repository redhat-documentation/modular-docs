= Modular Documentation Terms and Definitions

Assembly:: A collection of several modules combined into a larger piece of text, preceded by an introduction that explains the purpose of the assembly.
+
The docs realization of a _user story_.

Module:: A building block of information with a well-organized structure.
+
Because modules are written as context-free elements independent of other modules, they are re-usable: one module can be part of multiple assemblies.
+
Concept Module::: Explains a concept; i.e. not action-based.
Procedure Module::: Describes steps to perform an action.
Reference Module::: Presents detailed reference material, for example, command syntax.

User Story:: A short description of something the user does to achieve a goal.
+
Example: As an administrator, I want to set up authentication to a critical system in my infrastructure (gateway VPN, accounting system) to only allow users authenticated via strong authentication methods (two-factor authentication).
+
As opposed to a _use case_, which is a description of interactions between the system and the user or other systems.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To fulfill their purpose, user stories must be defined based on customer needs. Therefore, they must be produced by customer-facing associates (such as product management or field teams), not by writers. Writers can only help polish the user stories if required.

If your team does not have user stories, do not write them yourselves. Instead, ask the stakeholders for your product to provide them to you.
====

User story-based docs:: Docs developed to support a user story. For our purposes, user-story-based docs are the same as use-case-based docs.

Modular docs:: Docs structured into modules and assemblies.

NOTE: We do not use the terms _topic_ or _topic-based documentation_ because they are too ambiguous. A _topic_ can mean a piece of documentation, a user story, or a short chunk of content. Therefore, topic-based can mean a number of things.
