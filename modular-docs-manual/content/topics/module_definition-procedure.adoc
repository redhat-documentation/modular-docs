= Procedure Module Definition

A procedure module is a "do" module. It gives the user numbered, step-by-step instructions.

IMPORTANT: A procedure module does not consist solely of a procedure. At the very least, the steps must be preceded by an introduction statement that provides context for the procedure. For details, see <<writing-the-introduction>>.
