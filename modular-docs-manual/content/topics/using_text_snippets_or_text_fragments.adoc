// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
// * file name: my-concept-module-a.adoc
// * ID: [id="my-concept-module-a_{context}"]
// * Title: = My concept module A

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
[id="using_text_snippets_or_text_fragments_{context}"]
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes a variable that sets the context, such as {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.
= Text Snippets or Text Fragments (Pseudo-modules)
//In the title of concept modules, include nouns or noun phrases that are used in the body text. This helps readers and search engines find the information quickly.
//Do not start the title of concept modules with a verb. See also _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

[NOTE]
The following standard is recommended when the documentation is being maintained without a Content Management System (CMS) capable of managing complex interrelations between modules.

Use reusable text snippet files (or text fragment files) only for the following:

* Standardized admonitions (such as 'Technology preview' and 'Beta' text).
* Where there is an existing standard between the upstream and downstream communities.
* Any content that is used without modification across modules. Ensure that any change to this content must necessarily hold true for each module that includes it.

Follow these rules when creating text snippet files:

* Store the text snippet files in a directory that contains static resources. For example, the `_artifatcs` directory. 
* Ensure that when you include text snippet files in a module, you do not make the module source difficult to follow.

//.Additional resources

//* A bulleted list of links to other material closely related to the contents of the concept module.
