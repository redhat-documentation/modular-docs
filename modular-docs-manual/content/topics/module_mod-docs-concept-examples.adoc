How Ceph Works with Satellite 5

*CONCEPT EXPLANATION*

When a Red Hat Ceph Storage node is connected to a Red Hat Satellite 5 Server, the server hosts package repositories and provides system updates.

Once you register the Red Hat Ceph Storage nodes with the Satellite 5 server, you can deliver upgrades to the Ceph cluster without allowing a direct connection to the Internet, as well as search and view errata applicable to the cluster nodes.
