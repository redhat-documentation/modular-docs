= Creating Assemblies

An assembly is a representation of a user story, so you need to create an assembly for each user story that you defined.

An assembly could represent an article, "chapter" in a book, or even an entire book. However, one of the benefits of modular documentation is that you do not need to worry about how the assembly will ultimately be used -- each assembly represents a user goal, and once you create it, it can be "included" anywhere it is needed (a publication, within another assembly, and so on).

Be sure to follow the conventions for xref:anchor-and-file-names[naming anchors and files]. For example: `assembly_guided-decision-tables.adoc`
--

. For each top-level assembly file that you created, fill in the content.

For more information, see xref:assembly-guidelines[Assembly Guidelines].

. Repeat the previous step for each second-level assembly.
