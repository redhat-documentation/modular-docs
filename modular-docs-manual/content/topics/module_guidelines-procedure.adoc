= Procedure Module Guidelines

The required parts of a procedure module are a procedure and its introduction. Optionally, the module can also include prerequisites and additional resources.

== Procedure Introduction
The introduction is a short description of the procedure. For example, it can be a lead-in sentence or an infinitive phrase (_To extract the certificate: <steps>_). See also _The IBM Style Guide_ footnoteref:[ibm-style-guide,DERESPINIS, Francis, Peter HAYWARD, Jana JENKINS, Amy LAIRD, Leslie McDONALD, Eric RADZINKSI. _The IBM style guide: conventions for writers and editors_. Upper Saddle River, NJ: IBM Press/Pearson, c2012. ISBN 0132101300.] for details on introducing procedures.

The introduction typically provides context for the procedure, such as:

* Who is the user performing the procedure
* Why and where the user performs the procedure
* Special considerations specific to the procedure

Keep the information brief and focused on what the user needs for this specific procedure. Suggested length is 1--3 sentences, but it can be longer.

== Procedure Prerequisites
Prerequisites are conditions that must be satisfied before the user starts the procedure. If a prerequisite is a procedure or an assembly, include a link to them. See also _The IBM Style Guide_ footnoteref:[ibm-style-guide] for details on writing prerequisites.

Focus on relevant prerequisites that users might not otherwise be aware of. Do not list obvious prerequisites.

Use a bulleted list for prerequisites, even if you only have a single prerequisite.

[discrete]
== Procedure Body
The procedure consists of one or more steps required to complete the procedure. Each step describes one action.

For single-step procedures, use an unnumbered bullet instead of a numbered list.

[discrete]
== Procedure Additional Resources

The optional additional resources list links to other material closely related to the contents of the procedure module, for example, other documentation resources, instructional videos, or labs.
Because of current tooling limitations, you cannot include xref links to other content in your collection in the procedure module.
You can include xref links in the assembly that contains the procedure.

Focus on relevant resources that are likely to be of immediate interest to the user. Do not list resources for completeness.
