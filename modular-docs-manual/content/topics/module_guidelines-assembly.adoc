= Assembly Guidelines

The required parts of an assembly are the introduction and modules. Optionally, an assembly can also include prerequisites and additional resources.

[discrete]
== Assembly context

The `context` attribute is a keyword that enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes `{context}`, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.

When a module is *reused*, the context attribute needs to be _redefined_ to avoid duplicate anchor IDs.

For example:

----
:context: product_config_linux
include::modules/configuring-the-web-server-for-secure-connections.adoc

...

:context: product_config_windows
include::modules/configuring-the-web-server-for-secure-connections.adoc
----

== Assembly Introduction

The introduction explains what the user will accomplish by working through the assembled modules. It typically provides context for the assembly.

Consider rewording the user story to write the assembly introduction, for example:

* User story: As an administrator, I want to provide external identity, authentication and authorization services for my Atomic Host, so that users from external identity sources can access the Atomic Host.
* Assembly introduction: As a system administrator, you can use SSSD in a container to provide external identity, authentication, and authorization services for the Atomic Host system. This enables users from external identity sources to authenticate to the Atomic Host.

== Assembly Prerequisites

Prerequisites are conditions that must be satisfied before the user can start following the assembly.

// [bhardest] - We have a lot of xref-ing in these guidelines. A better approach might be to create a "snippets" .adoc file with snippets of common content (for example, the content about writing prerequisites, which applies to multiple sections). Then we can just include the relevant content from the snippets file wherever it's needed.
// [asteflova] - Let's do this after we finish reviewing the guidelines for procedures and assemblies.
// [sterobin] - I removed the cross-ref to the procedure "Writing prerequisites" for now because it provided no value and the id for that linked section needed to be removed anyway (should only be linking to modules, not module sub-headings). This clearly now provides little information, but based on the above comments, we should be looking into a better structure all around in this doc for describing the prereq, intro, body components that apply universally.

== Assembly Modules

List link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/#include-files[include files] to include the required modules. Use any combination of concept, procedure, and reference modules that fulfills the purpose of the assembly.

[discrete]
== Assembly Additional Resources

The optional additional resources list links to other material closely related to the contents of the assembly, for example, other documentation resources, instructional videos, or labs.

Focus on relevant resources that are likely to be of immediate interest to the user. Do not list resources for completeness.
