Retains the context of the parent assembly if this assembly is nested within another assembly.

ifdef::context[:parent-context: {context}]

////
Pantheon v2 extracts some information from variables defined in the document content. These variables must be defined at the header level (not at the body level); otherwise, Pantheon v2 cannot extract them.

As of this writing, the only such variable is `:_module-type:`, but future development may introduce other such variables as well.
////
:_module-type: ASSEMBLY

////
 Base the file name and the ID on the assembly title. For example:
* file name: assembly-my-user-story.adoc
* ID: [id="assembly-my-user-story_{context}"]
* Title: = My user story

The ID is an anchor that links to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken. Include {context} in the ID so the assembly can be reused.
////

[id="assembly-my-user-story_{context}"]
= My user story
////
If the assembly covers a task, start the title with a verb in the gerund form, such as Creating or Configuring.
////

:context: assembly-keyword

////
The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID so you can include it multiple times in the same guide.
////

[role="_abstract"]
This paragraph is the assembly introduction. It explains what the user will accomplish by working through the modules in the assembly and sets the context for the user story the assembly is based on. The text that immediately follows the `[role="_abstract"]` tag is used for search metadata.

== Prerequisites

* A bulleted list of conditions that must be satisfied before the user starts following this assembly.
* You can also link to other modules or assemblies the user must follow before starting this assembly.
* Delete the section title and bullets if the assembly has no prerequisites.
* X is installed. For information about installing X, see <link>.
* You can log in to X with administrator privileges.

////
The following include statements pull in the module files that comprise the assembly. Include any combination of concept, procedure, or reference modules required to cover the user story. You can also include other assemblies.
////

include::modules/TEMPLATE_CONCEPT_explaining_a_concept.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

////
[leveloffset=+1] ensures that when a module title is a level 1 heading (= Title), the heading will be interpreted as a level-2 heading (== Title) in the assembly. Use [leveloffset=+2] and [leveloffset=+3] to nest modules in an assembly.
////

include::modules/TEMPLATE_PROCEDURE_doing_one_procedure.adoc[leveloffset=+2]
include::modules/TEMPLATE_PROCEDURE_reference-material.adoc[leveloffset=2]

[role="_additional-resources"]
== Additional resources (or Next steps)
////
Optional. Delete if not used.
////
* A bulleted list of links to other material closely related to the contents of the assembly, including xref links to other assemblies in your collection.
* For more details on writing assemblies, see the link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs#modular-documentation-reference-guide[Modular Documentation Reference Guide].
* Use a consistent system for file names, IDs, and titles. For tips, see _Anchor Names and File Names_ in link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs#modular-documentation-reference-guide[Modular Documentation Reference Guide].
