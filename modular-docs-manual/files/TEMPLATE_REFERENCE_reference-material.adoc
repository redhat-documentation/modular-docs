Pantheon v2 extracts some information from variables defined in the document content. These variables must be defined at the header level (not at the body level); otherwise, Pantheon v2 cannot extract them.

As of this writing, the only such variable is `:_module-type:`, but future development may introduce other such variables as well.
////
:_module-type: ASSEMBLY

////
Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
* file name: ref-my-reference-a.adoc
* ID: [id="ref-my-reference-a_{context}"]
* Title: = My reference A

The ID is an anchor that links to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
////

[id="ref-reference-material_{context}"]
////
The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide
////
= Reference material
////
In the title of a reference module, include nouns that are used in the body text. For example, "Keyboard shortcuts for ___" or "Command options for ___." This helps readers and search engines find the information quickly.
////

[role="_abstract"]
Write a short introductory paragraph that provides an overview of the module. The text that immediately follows the `[role="_abstract"]` tag is used for search metadata. A reference module provides data that users might want to look up, but do not need to remember.
It has a very strict structure, often in the form of a list or a table.
A well-organized reference module enables users to scan it quickly to find the details they want.
AsciiDoc markup to consider for reference data:

* A bulleted list of links to other material closely related to the contents of the concept module.
* Currently, modules cannot include xrefs, so you cannot include links to other content in your collection. If you need to link to another assembly, add the xref to the assembly that includes this module.
