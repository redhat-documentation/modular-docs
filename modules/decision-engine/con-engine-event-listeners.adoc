= {DECISION_ENGINE_CAP} event listeners and debug logging

[WARNING]
====
The APIs for {DECISION_ENGINE} event listeners in {PRODUCT} are subject to change.
====

In {PRODUCT}, you can add or remove listeners for {DECISION_ENGINE} events, such as fact insertions and rule executions. With {DECISION_ENGINE} event listeners, you can be notified of {DECISION_ENGINE} activity and separate your logging and auditing work from the core of your application.

The {DECISION_ENGINE} supports the following default event listeners for the agenda and working memory:

* `AgendaEventListener`
* `WorkingMemoryEventListener`

.WorkingMemoryEventManager

endif::[]

For each event listener, the {DECISION_ENGINE} also supports the following specific events that you can specify to be monitored:

* `MatchCreatedEvent`
* `MatchCancelledEvent`
* `BeforeMatchFiredEvent`
* `AfterMatchFiredEvent`
* `AgendaGroupPushedEvent`
* `AgendaGroupPoppedEvent`
* `ObjectInsertEvent`
* `ObjectDeletedEvent`
* `ObjectUpdatedEvent`
* `ProcessCompletedEvent`
* `ProcessNodeLeftEvent`
* `ProcessNodeTriggeredEvent`
* `ProcessStartEvent`

For example, the following code uses a `DefaultAgendaEventListener` listener and specifies the `AfterMatchFiredEvent` event to be monitored. The code prints pattern matches after the rules are executed (fired):

.Example code to monitor and print `AfterMatchFiredEvent` events in the agenda
[source,java]
----
public class MyListener extends DefaultAgendaEventListener {
    public void afterMatchFired(AfterMatchFiredEvent event) {
        super.afterMatchFired( event );
        System.out.println( event );
    }
}

@ApplicationScoped
public class RuleEventListenerConfig extends DefaultRuleEventListenerConfig {
    public RuleEventListenerConfig() {
        super(new MyListener());
    }
}
----

The {DECISION_ENGINE} also supports the following agenda and working memory event listeners for debug logging:

* `DebugAgendaEventListener`
* `DebugRuleRuntimeEventListener`

These event listeners implement the same supported event-listener methods and include a debug print statement by default. You can add a specific supported event to be monitored and documented, or monitor all agenda or working memory activity.

For example, the following code uses the `DebugRuleRuntimeEventListener` event listener to monitor and print all working memory events:

.Example code to monitor and print all working memory events
[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class RuleEventListenerConfig extends DefaultRuleEventListenerConfig {
    public RuleEventListenerConfig() {
        super(new DebugRuleRuntimeEventListener());
    }
}
