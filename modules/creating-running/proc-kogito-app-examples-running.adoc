= Running the {PRODUCT} example applications

To get started quickly with {PRODUCT}, you can run any of the example applications in the https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples[`kogito-examples`] repository in GitHub and experiment with the {PRODUCT} services.

For this procedure, use the https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/process-quarkus-example[`process-quarkus-example`] or https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/process-springboot-example[`process-springboot-example`] application. You can follow similar steps with the other {PRODUCT} examples on Quarkus or Spring Boot.

In the `process-quarkus-example` and `process-springboot-example` applications, the `orders.bpmn2` process describes the steps that need to be followed when ordering items. The process includes a script task for writing debug information and a call activity for invoking a subprocess, using a custom `Order` data object.

.Example `orders.bpmn2` process
image::kogito/creating-running/bpmn-model-example-orders.png[Image of `orders.bpmn` example process]

The `Add items` subprocess invokes the following `orderItems.bpmn2` process, which uses a `CalculationService.calculateTotal` custom Java service and a user task to verify the order.

.Example `orderItems.bpmn2` process invoked as a subprocess
image::kogito/creating-running/bpmn-model-example-order-items.png[Image of `orderItems.bpmn` example process]

The `persons.bpmn2` process invokes a Drools Rule Languge (DRL) rule unit in a business rule task to determine customer age, followed by a user task for special handling requirements for children, if applicable.

.Example `persons.bpmn2` process invoked as a subprocess
image::kogito/creating-running/kogito-bpmn-example-person.png[Image of `persons` process diagram]

Based on these processes and on application configurations, this example service exposes REST operations to create new orders, to list and delete active orders, and to determine the age of a specified person.

.Procedure
. Download the latest https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/releases[`kogito-examples`] release to a local directory and extract the file.
. In a command terminal, navigate to the extracted `kogito-examples-__RELEASE__/process-__PLATFORM__-example` folder, and enter one of the following commands to build and run the example.

Quarkus and Spring Boot support the following run modes:

* *Development mode*: For local testing. On Quarkus, development mode also offers live reload of your processes and decisions in your running applications for advanced debugging.
* *JVM mode*: For compatibility with a Java virtual machine (JVM).
ifdef::KOGITO-COMM[]
* *Native mode*: (Quarkus only, requires GraalVM) For direct binary execution as native code.
endif::[]

The command that you use depends on your preferred run mode and application environment:

* For development mode:
+
.On Quarkus
[source]
----
mvn clean compile quarkus:dev
----
+
.On Sprint Boot
[source]
----
mvn clean compile spring-boot:run
----
+
* For JVM mode:
+
.On Quarkus and Spring Boot
[source]
----
mvn clean package
java -jar target/sample-kogito-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar
----
+
ifdef::KOGITO-COMM[]
* For native mode (requires GraalVM):
+
.On Quarkus only
[source]
----
mvn clean package -Dnative
./target/sample-kogito-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner
----
+
endif::[]
--
. After the {PRODUCT} service is running, use a REST client, curl utility, or the Swagger UI configured for the application at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/ to send API requests with the following components:
+
--
* *URL*: `\http://localhost:8080/`
* *HTTP headers*:
** `accept`: `application/json`
** `content-type`: `application/json`
* *HTTP methods*: `GET`, `POST`, or `DELETE`

.Example POST request body to create an order (JSON)
[source,json]
----
{
  "approver": "john",
  "order": {
    "orderNumber": "12345",
    "shipped": false
  }
}
----

.Example curl command to create an order
[source]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/orders -H 'content-type: application/json' -H 'accept: application/json' -d '{"approver" : "john", "order" : {"orderNumber" : "12345", "shipped" : false}}'
----

.Example response (JSON)
[source,json]
----
{
  "approver": "john",
  "id": "6b53c227-6d5e-40b7-8c8c-a541a2a47d58",
  "order": {
    "orderNumber": "12345",
    "shipped": false,
    "total": 0.3845152065899532
  }
}

.Swagger UI to interact with all application endpoints (\http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/)
image::kogito/creating-running/kogito-swagger-example-jbpm.png[Image of Swagger UI for example application]

NOTE: For the predefined {PRODUCT} example applications, the Swagger UI for interacting with service endpoints is available only on Quarkus examples that you run in
ifdef::KOGITO-ENT[]
development mode.
endif::[]
ifdef::KOGITO-COMM[]
development mode or in native mode.
endif::[]

This example procedure uses the following curl commands for convenience:

* Create an order:
+
.Example request
[source]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/orders -H 'content-type: application/json' -H 'accept: application/json' -d '{"approver" : "john", "order" : {"orderNumber" : "12345", "shipped" : false}}'
----
+
.Example response
[source]
----
{"approver":"john","id":"6b53c227-6d5e-40b7-8c8c-a541a2a47d58","order":{"orderNumber":"12345","shipped":false,"total":0.3845152065899532}}
----
+
The new order has an `"id"` field with a generated UUID that you can use to retrieve details about this specific order, if needed.

* View active orders:
+
.Example request
[source]
----
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/orders -H 'content-type: application/json' -H 'accept: application/json'
----
+
.Example response
[source]
----
[{"approver":"john","id":"6b53c227-6d5e-40b7-8c8c-a541a2a47d58","order":{"orderNumber":"12345","shipped":false,"total":0.3845152065899532}}]
----

* View order details using the returned UUID:
+
.Example request
[source]
----
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/orders/6b53c227-6d5e-40b7-8c8c-a541a2a47d58 -H 'content-type: application/json' -H 'accept: application/json'

----
+
You use the `"id"` value for the order that was returned when you created the order or when you retrieved active orders.

* Cancel the order using the returned UUID:

----
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/orders/6b53c227-6d5e-40b7-8c8c-a541a2a47d58 -H 'content-type: application/json' -H 'accept: application/json'
