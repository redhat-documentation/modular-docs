= Packages in DRL

A package is a folder of related assets in {PRODUCT}, such as data objects, DRL files, decision tables, and other asset types. A package also serves as a unique namespace for each group of rules. A single rule base can contain multiple packages. You typically store all the rules for a package in the same file as the package declaration so that the package is self-contained. However, you can import objects from other packages that you want to use in the rules.

The following example is a package name and namespace for a DRL file in a mortgage application decision service:

.Example package definition in a DRL file

----
package org.mortgages;

ifdef::KOGITO-COMM[]

Note that a package _must_ have a namespace and be declared using standard Java conventions for package names; i.e., no spaces, unlike rule names which allow spaces.
In terms of the order of elements, they can appear in any order in the rule file, with the exception of the `package` and `unit` statements, which must be at the top of the file.
In all cases, the semicolons are optional.

Notice that any rule attribute (as described in the section xref:rules-attributes-ref-drl-rules[]) may also be written at package level, superseding the attribute's default value.
The modified default may still be replaced by an attribute setting within a rule.
